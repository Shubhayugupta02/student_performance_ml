            CyberML is a student performance analytics portal built with Flask,
            SQLite and scikit-learn.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teachers can upload student result datasets, train machine learning
            models, create assignments and grade submissions. The system computes
            grade distributions, feature importances and risk alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Students can experiment with a prediction form that uses attendance,
            study hours, assignment completion and internals to estimate
            expected final marks and grade, with personalised tips.

            The cyber-neon UI is designed to feel like a futuristic control panel
            while remaining simple enough for classroom use.
